## I think react native or expo is haunted

(Writing this one from the title and memory of events months ago)

I mean seriously things got to a point where the app had errors but only when the files were unblessed. Like, if I recreated the project and copied my files over then it'd be fine but a git clone was unacceptable. I even diff'd the different setups and nothing was different in terms of bytes. Maybe there was cached stuff in the emulator but no idea what would be cached so oh well.
