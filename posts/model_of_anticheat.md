Game development is an interesting area of software development.
There's so many bits of CS and math that it touches on just to work.
Linear algebra for a lot of graphics related things, finite state machines for some AI, [game matchmaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSkill) and more, some of which I'm completely unaware of.

I'm not interested in doing game dev myself but there's one problem in game dev which has some room for a different (probably) better solution.

So that's what this post is about, my current understanding of what most modern anti-cheats do and what I think would be a better solution.
