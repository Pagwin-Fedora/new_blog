~~get code blocks working properly, namely get them colored (probably with https://highlightjs.org/), maybe add a red border, consider https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js?tab=readme-ov-file#using-web-workers~~

~~get highlight js theme set to my preference, make sure to add nesting in CSS so it'll be active when the light/dark class is active~~

~~add CSS styling rule(s) so headers don't get link colors~~

~~center titles properly~~

~~center content box properly~~

~~position code blocks in a way I like~~
