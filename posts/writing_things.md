## What emphasis mine means

Today I learned that emphasis mine refers to when a quote has emphasis added to it by the person quoting via italics or boldening. It's short for "the emphasis is mine"

Example:

To provide an example I shall quote this post.

"Today I learned that **emphasis mine** refers to when a quote has emphasis added to it by the person quoting" \[emphasis mine\]

## What sic means

Asside from attack sic is also used in quotes to denote that an error was retained as is.

Example:

I will not quote this post in this example because doing the same thing twice without variation seems iffy.

"I will not quote this post in this example \[sic\] because doing the same thing twice without variation seems iffy"

### Above may be wrong/incomplete

Upon having this proofread by a friend they pointed out that my understanding of \[sic\] is incomplete. Linking me to a [merriam webster post](https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/sic-meaning-usage-editorial-citation) which says.

> [*Sic*](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sic) usually appears in parentheses or brackets, sometimes with the letters in italics. In this context it means “intentionally so written.” On its own, *sic* means “so” or “thus” and can be found in phrases such as *sic transit gloria mundi* ("so passes away the glory of the world") and *sic semper tyrannis* ("thus ever to tyrants," the motto of the state of Virginia).


> What is denoted by *sic* is that the word or phrase that precedes it occurs in the original passage being quoted or name being used and was not introduced by the writer doing the quoting.

If this correction is wrong the fault is on me for failing to do further research and double check before posting this.

## That's it

That's the whole post I just wanted to share that because I've been confused when I saw those until now. This isn't either of the 2 posts I had in mind when I mentioned that in the blog revamp.
